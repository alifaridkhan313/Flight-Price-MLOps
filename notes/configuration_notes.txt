Configuration related notes: 
This file is created and used after constants file 
This file is used to join the paths. 

The variables that we created in constants file will be used here. 
After the execution of the file it will take all the variables and create a new variable by joining all the paths. 
this is a simple logic that makes our code simpler and modular. 


In consatant file:
Variable_1 = name/file name 
In Configuration file::
Variable_2 = multiple Variable_1
